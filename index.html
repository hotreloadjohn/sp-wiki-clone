    <h2>Admission</h2>
    <h3>Early Admissions Exercise (EAE)</h3>
    <p>
      EAE is an admissions exercise that allows students to apply and receive
      conditional offers for admission to polytechnic based on their aptitudes
      and interests before taking their O-Level exams, or after completing their
      NITEC or Higher NITEC course at the Institute of Technical Education
      (ITE). This exercise replaced the Direct Polytechnic Admissions (DPA) and
      Joint Admission Exercise (JAE).
    </p>

    <p>
      PFP is an admissions exercise that allows the top 10% of Normal Academic
      (NA) students to apply to a polytechnic without going through O-Level. PFP
      students will go through a one-year course, teaching them the foundations
      of subjects that will be needed in their diploma year. If the student
      passes PFP, they will move onto their diploma courses. Additional
      scholarships and awards are available to those who do well in their
      foundation year.[6]
